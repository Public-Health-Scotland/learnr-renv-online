# PHS Training App Template

*Interactive web-application branded for Public Health Scotland.*

This repo hosts a template for building learnr apps, these are primarily used for self-directed (asynchronous) training but can be used for synchronous sessions or guidance material.

### Directories
  As this is a shiny prerendered project, only certain filenames are accessible from within the app. These are outlined below:
  * `css` - css styling scripts
  * `images` - images used within the app
  * `www` - other accessible static files
    + `data` - data files made available for use as part of the app
    
### Files
  * `.gitignore` - tells git what files and folders *not* to track or upload to GitHub
  * `Intro.Rmd` - RMarkdown file containing all necessary code to build app
  * `Intro.html` - generated HTML from building app
  * `PHS-LearnR.Proj` - R project
  * `README.md` - this page
